# Need to calculate output of recursion algorythm

Output

    Entering 1 loop. a = 3; b = 5
    Entering 2 loop. a = 3; b = 2
    Entering 3 loop. a = 3; b = 1
    Entering 4 loop. a = 3; b = 0
    Exiting from loop 4. b == 0. returning 1
    
    Assigning in loop 3. t = 1
    Exiting from loop 3. b (1) is not even. returning t*t*a (1*1*3) = 3
    
    Assigning in loop 2. t = 3
    Exiting from loop 2. b (2) is even. returning t*t (3*3) = 9
    
    Assigning in loop 1. t = 9
    Exiting from loop 1. b (5) is not even. returning t*t*a (9*9*3) = 243
    
    Output is 243
